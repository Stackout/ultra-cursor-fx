# UltraCursorFX – High-Visibility Cursor Effects & Accessibility Addon

UltraCursorFX is an accessibility-focused World of Warcraft addon that significantly improves mouse cursor visibility during gameplay. It adds high-contrast particle trails, glow effects, pulse animations, and optional click and comet effects to ensure the cursor remains easy to track in all situations.

This addon is designed to solve a common problem for many players: losing track of the mouse cursor during intense combat, raids, PvP, or when playing on large or ultrawide monitors. UltraCursorFX works out of the box with sensible defaults while offering extensive customization for players who want full control.

## Situational Profiles (NEW in v0.2.0)

UltraCursorFX now features **automatic profile switching** based on your current location. Configure different cursor effects for different situations and let the addon automatically apply them:

- **World Profile** – Your default cursor for open-world content
- **Raid Profile** – Optimized visibility for raid encounters
- **Dungeon Profile** – Settings tailored for 5-man dungeons
- **Arena Profile** – High-visibility configuration for PvP arenas
- **Battleground Profile** – Custom effects for battleground combat

Each profile can have completely different settings: colors, trail lengths, particle shapes, click effects, and more. The addon automatically detects when you enter a raid, dungeon, arena, or battleground and switches to your configured profile.

### Profile Workflow

1. **Adjust your settings** – Tweak trail size, color, effects, and all other options
2. **Save to a profile** – Click "Save" on any situational profile to store current settings
3. **Auto-switch enabled** – Toggle "Enable Situational Cursors" to activate automatic switching
4. **Manual loading** – Click "Load" on any profile to instantly apply those settings

This makes it easy to have subtle effects while questing but maximum visibility during raid progression, or bright colors in PvE but specific colors matching your PvP UI.

## Core Functionality

UltraCursorFX visually enhances the mouse cursor using lightweight, GPU-accelerated effects that follow the cursor's movement in real time.

### Key features include:

- A persistent particle trail that follows the cursor
- High-contrast glow effects for improved visibility
- Optional pulsing animation to draw attention to the cursor location
- Click burst effects to highlight mouse clicks
- Optional comet mode for elongated, directional trails
- Smooth motion interpolation to prevent jitter
- **Situational profile auto-switching for different game modes**

All effects are purely visual and do not alter gameplay mechanics, targeting, or input behavior.

## Accessibility-Focused Design

UltraCursorFX was built with accessibility as a primary goal. It is especially useful for:

- Players with reduced vision or visual impairments
- Players using large, high-resolution, or ultrawide displays
- Older players who need stronger visual contrast
- Players who experience cursor loss during chaotic encounters
- Night or low-light gameplay environments
- **Players who need different visibility settings for different content types**

The addon allows players to dramatically increase cursor visibility without relying on external software or operating-system-level cursor modifications.
