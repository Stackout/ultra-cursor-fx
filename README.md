## 🎯 **Stop Losing Your Cursor!**

### Are you constantly losing track of your mouse cursor during intense gameplay?
### Do you find yourself squinting at the screen, frantically waving your mouse around just to locate that tiny arrow?
### Tired of dying in raids because you couldn't see where you were clicking?

**You're not alone.** Many players—especially those with vision challenges, playing on large monitors, or in chaotic battle situations—struggle with the default cursor being nearly invisible.

**UltraCursorFX is an accessibility-focused addon that solves this problem.** With brilliant particle trails, customizable colors, and attention-grabbing effects, you'll **never lose your cursor again**.
